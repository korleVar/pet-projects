### Preamble <div id="11"></div>

REST is an architectural style, a set of rules for how systems or components interact to exchange data. REST is a consistent set of constraints that are considered when designing system interactions.

## Chapter II <div id="chapter-ii"></div>

### General Rules <div id="21"></div>

1. Along the way, you may feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information: that's OK. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you. So are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate. Search. Use common sense. Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to sources of information. Check. Think. Analyse. Compare. 
3. Look at the text of each assignment. Read it several times. 
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the task itself.
5. You may find inconsistencies where something new in the terms of the task or examples conflicts with something you already know. If you come across such an inconsistency, try to work it out. If not, write it down as an open question and find out as you work. Do not leave open questions unanswered. 
6. If a task seems confusing or impossible, it only seems that way. Try to break it down. It is likely that some parts will become clear. 
7. There will be several tasks. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the more meticulous students. These tasks are more difficult and are not compulsory. But doing them will give you extra experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to fool the system or the people around you. You will fool yourself first.
9. Got a question? Ask your neighbour to the right. If that doesn't help, ask your neighbour on the left.
10. When you use help, you should always understand why and how. Otherwise the help is useless.
11. Always push only to the develop branch! The master branch will be ignored. Work in the src directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III <div id="chapter-iii"></div>

### 1. Theory <div id="31"></div>

REST (Representational State Transfer, [Roy Fielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding) 2000г.) is an architectural style for providing standards for communication between computer systems in a network. Following the standards makes it easier for systems to communicate with each other. Systems that are REST-compliant and are often referred to as RESTful. 

A RESTful integration architecture should follow the 6 principles (Fielding's Constraints):

1. Client-server architecture: separation of responsibilities; client and server functions are separated. 
2. Statelessness: the server receives all the information to process in each request (does not store the information in itself).
3. Cacheability: the server stores responses for future use.
4. Uniform interface (HATEOAS): style constraints by which the server returns not only the resource, but also its relationships to other resources and the actions that can be performed on it.
5. Layered system: neither the client nor the server is aware of the call chain beyond their direct contacts.
6. Code on demand: transfer of executable code (optional).

You can learn more about the principles and characteristics of the REST architectural style, advantages and disadvantages of the approach in the article by A. Burakov "REST, what are you? A clear introduction to the technology for IT analysts".

### 2. General Concepts <div id="31"></div>

**Data Presentation Format**: The way the data is transferred, such as:

- XML — information markup language;
- JSON — text format for exchanging data;
- Binary — binary format.

**Data Transfer Protocol:** A set of agreements that define how data is exchanged between systems and/or components of systems. The agreements specify:

- exchange rules;
- a set of data transfer formats;
- a uniform method of message transmission;
- error handling procedures.

**Transport:** Network transmission protocols.

**Resources: https://21-school.ru/blog**.

**https://** — sheme, transport indication, protocol.

**21-school.ru** — host, the server to communicate with. 

**blog** — resource, the object with which interaction is performed, School 21 blog.

**HTTP is a widely used data transfer protocol that was originally designed to transfer hypertext documents (i.e., documents that may contain links that allow you to navigate to other documents). It is also used to transfer arbitrary data.

**HTTP Methods**

The integration operations in RESTful are described by HTTP verbs.

There are 4 main HTTP methods that are used in requests to interact with resources in the REST system:

GET — retrieve a specific resource (by ID) or a collection of resources;

POST — create a new resource;

PUT — update a specific resource (by ID);

DELETE — delete a specific resource by ID.

**API** is:

- Application Programming Interface, a description of the way software systems or components of systems interact.
- A mechanism for interaction between program components.
- A product that allows external users to provide access to a system.

API is a contract (agreement, description) of interaction between programs. It contains:

- The operation that the system should (and can) perform;
- Input data (data received as input);
- Output data (data that can be obtained as a result of the operation);
- error messages (description of errors).  

Some articles on integration and APIs:

1. [Molechka](https://habr.com/ru/users/Molechka/) "What is API" <https://habr.com/ru/articles/464261/#directly>.
2. [katherine_a](https://habr.com/ru/users/katherine_a/) "How an analyst should work with tasks on integration — step-by-step instructions" https://habr.com/ru/articles/735332/.

### 3. Documentation <div id="33"></div>

The documentation includes:

1) syntax of request and response (what is passed, how it is passed);
2) examples of request and response;
3) description of input and output parameters (what we pass in request and response).

Example documentation: <https://yandex.ru/dev/rasp/doc/reference/schedule-point-point.html>

### 4. Mapping <div id="34"></div>

One of the most important parts of an integration analyst's job is mapping data from different sides of the integration. Data in systems that communicate with each other and in data that is transferred may be stored in different structures. For example, in one system the full name is a single required field, in another system it is three fields and only two of them are required and the patronymic may not be filled in, and in a third system all three fields are required. Or when specifying monetary amounts: when transferring (reading/writing) monetary data in numeric format, rounding distortions may occur. 

Mapping is the assignment of data fields in different data storage and transmission sources. Consider whether data mapping is required for almost any type of exchange. 

What to compare and consider when mapping

1. Identifier — the system name of the field under which the data is stored in the source or transmitted in the message. If the field is stored in a table — a record with a period (table identifier, field identifier). Or the name of the table is written above, as a table of contents of the field group.
2. Business name / description of the field.
3. Data type (text, number (integer or fractional), date, list of values, etc.). 
4. Dimensionality (length of the field).
5. Mandatory; may be different for sending and receiving systems.
6. Comments: conditions, restrictions, processing/transformation order, if necessary.

### 5. Errors Handling <div id="35"></div>

The receiving system accepts messages generated by another system. It is not always the case that the sending system generates the message as agreed in the contract. Therefore, when receiving a message, the receiving system should check the message it receives. And if incorrect messages are received, the sending system should be notified of the problem. The system can send such messages in the response (in the error message field). The description of received inconsistencies is usually prepared by the analyst, as he/she knows well what should be checked in the received message. Format requirements (data type, dimensionality, mandatory), presence in the reference (if it is a link to a record in the reference), other logical conditions are checked. 

In addition, error messages contain other information, such as the inaccessibility of the receiving system. 

## Chapter IV <div id="chapter-iv"></div>

### Description of tasks

### Task 1. Haircut Appointment<div id="41"></div>

The management of a chain of barbershops decided to implement an online booking system. The main objective is to develop the business by expanding the customer base through the possibility of online registration, as well as to reduce employee labour costs and manual labour by automatically informing customers through communication channels. 

Both registered and unregistered visitors can book an appointment on the website. When making an appointment, they can select the type of service: hairdressing or cosmetology, as well as the service itself, the master and the time from the available intervals. The system should provide automatic sending of reminders to clients through the communication channel chosen by the client (Telegram, WhatsApp, VK, SMS) according to the schedule set by the manager. After receiving a service, the system offers the client to evaluate the service and write suggestions on how to improve the work.

The schedule of masters and the services provided by each master should be entered by the manager, who may be more than one person. This person is also responsible for keeping the schedule up to date and adjusting it if necessary, communicating with customers manually, marking the service, charging and accepting payment, sending the payment data to the accounting department. The manager can also receive reports on completed services and view customer feedback.

Each master has the ability to view the schedule and appointments for their services, as well as customer reviews.
